### tl;dr

I'm a <span id="age"></span> year old software developer. I mainly [hack](https://github.com/jamiehannaford) on PHP, Go and any other cool open-source projects I can get my hands on. I'm also really interested in functional languages like Haskell, but don't have much extensive experience. I currently work for the [Rackspace Developer Experience group](http://developer.rackspace.com/).

### To Begin at the Beginning

I was born and raised in Plymouth, a town on the south-west coast of the UK known to most as the proud home of some [old colonists](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pilgrim_Fathers), its [harbours](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barbican,_Plymouth), and a [forgettably average](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plymouth_Argyle_F.C.) football team. I'd always wanted to be a barrister when I was growing up, probably due to my exceptional skills in pointless arguing and penchant for wigs.

### Mortarboard

I spent three years studying English Literature at [Hogwarts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder%27s_Building). I stayed for an extra year to specialize in Shakespeare and medieval literature for my Masters. I got my first programmer job because I couldn't think of a decent PhD topic. 

"How is this relevant to programming?" I hear you cry. Studying the archaic and sometimes bizarre logic of medieval writers has prepared me wonderfully for the times I have to revisit old code.

### Where?

As of 2015, Berlin.

### Political and social beliefs

Unapologetically left-wing:

* same-sex marriage and LGBT rights
* gender equality, both generally and in the workplace
* environmentalism
* social welfare for the most vulnerable
* immigration and providing asylum to those in danger
* initiatives to end capital punishment

### Current interests

I tend to shuffle across different past-times as my fickleness allows, but I've recently been attempting German. I'm also deeply interested in rekindling my amateuer interest in pure mathematics. Aside from that: beer, music and Manchester United.

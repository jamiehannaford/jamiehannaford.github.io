### tl;dr

I'm a 25 year old software developer. I mainly hack on PHP, Ruby, and any cool OSS projects I can get my hands on. I currently work for the [Rackspace DRG](http://developer.rackspace.com/).

### To Begin at the Beginning

I was born and raised in Plymouth, a town on the south-west coast of the UK. I'd always wanted to be a lawyer when I was growing up, probably due to my exceptional skills in pointless arguing.

### Mortarboard

I spent three years studying English Literature at [Hogwarts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founder%27s_Building). I stayed for an extra year to specialize in Shakespeare and medieval literature for my Masters. I got my first programmer job because I couldn't think of a decent PhD topic.

### Where?

I moved to Basel when I was 24, like Nietzsche. Except without all the prophetic madness. If I could live anywhere in the world, I would probably pick Berlin.

### Politics

Wildly left-wing. I passionately support:

* same-sex marriage and LGBT rights
* gender equality, both generally and in the workplace
* environmentalism
* social welfare for the most vulnerable
* immigration and providing asylum to those in danger
* initiatives to end capital punishment

### Current interests

I'm learning German and pure mathemetics.

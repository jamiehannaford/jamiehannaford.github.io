As I read through the first installation of George R. R. Martin's *Song of Ice and Dance* novels this week, a stark reality hit me. I've been a fan of *Game of Thrones* ever since it came out on TV, but this was the first time I had set down to read the book. What I hadn't realised was just how gratuitously violent the plot is, especially towards women. The reason this surprised me was that hitherto I hadn't even noticed, which made me question whether the subjugation of women had -- through its ubiquity -- become a unquestioned trope of modern television.

George R. R. Martin's plot takes on the genre of a historical fiction: its context and setting loosely based around Medieval Europe. Reading closely, you can get faint whiffs of historical correlation: Robert Baratheon has the fierce rage, impatience, boorishness and corpulence of Henry VIII; Cersei Lannister is cold, ruthless and manipulative as Anne Boleyn; Eddard Stack has the phlegmatism, steadfastness and pride of Thomas Cromwell. So it's not a stretch to excuse the misogyny of Martin's plot as the product of historical realism. Scholars have long been aware of the misogyny of medieval life, so why shouldn't novels based on this life preserve that sense of realism?

The answer, for me at least, is No. All authors have an obligation to upholds the value of the present world, not a world that expired half a millennium ago. History should never be an excuse to subjugate or discriminate; on the contrary, it should enlighten us to treat people better because of the nightmare precedents set before us.

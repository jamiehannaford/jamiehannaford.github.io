> The car engine made a steady growling noise, and I remember thinking it was
funny that those long-dead plants had been turned into the oil that had been
turned into the petrol that made the car growl. I chose to forget the absence
of reptiles in those carboniferous forests, and imagined that they had been
populated by great dinosaurs, and that they too had fallen into the ooze, and
made up part of the oil, and that the noise the car made was like the angry,
bellowing growls they would have made while they were alive, as though their
last dying breath, their last sound on this planet, had been saved all these
millions and millions of years, to be exhaled along a little road on a little
island, pushing the McHoan family north, one summer, on our holidays.
